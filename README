// Description : Ansible Playbook for Initial Server Setup.
//============================================================================

This Ansible Playbook is intended to be used by Server Administrators for servers both public and private.

The Playbook implements some common and not so common sense security features that should be present on every server.

The current target is currently a Debian Servers but that is likely to expand later in development.
